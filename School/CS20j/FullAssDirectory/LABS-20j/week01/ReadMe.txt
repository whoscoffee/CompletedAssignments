Hello
This is what i worked on in Week one, it took me quite soome time,
i started with a sample scene from here:
https://docs.oracle.com/javafx/8/3d_graphics/sampleapp.htm#CJAHFAF

And then i stated making seperate classes , like a tool bar which 
can create a box sphere or Cylinder, and when an object was clicked on
, you could change its translate, rotate, and scale x,y's,and z's.
but i ran into a bunch or problems and havent come around to it,'
i think i spend like 6 hours just looking at the api's
one problem, was that when one obj is selected, then when i select
a second object it deletes the first... so yea, its has todo with
how i stored the selected obj, anyways my solution in my head is to 
stick obj properties and toolbar back into Window.java so i can just
better understand how my stuff is connectedf, because(atleast for me)
when i have multiple classes, i can get confused on how classes send 
infomation to oneanothere , especially when its an applications thats 
"running"

oh also my code doesnt work on this plateform at alll, so yea, altho this code
does work on vscode. uh, also Xform is not my code, that i got from oracle
and hasnt been changed at all, i need to understand nodes better before i 
recode that the way i want it, because its a little confusing...
