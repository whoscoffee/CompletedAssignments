Use these folders to file the programs you write during your
TBA hours for each week

THESE FOLDERS ARE NOT FOR THE (GRADED) PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENTS!

See the course documents for the number of hours required
for each week

During Spring semesters, you don't record hours for SPRING BREAK,
and skip counting it.
None of the files I've given you represent Spring Break,
so don't leave any of them blank.

So the weeks files are for the nth week of instruction,
not the nth calendar week.
So use all week01 through week15 directories
for both Spring and Fall semesters

For example in Spring 2012, Spring Break was Monday,
April 9 through Saturday April 14th,
so record your TBA hours of the week of Monday, April 2nd in week09
and your TBA hours of the week of Monday, April 16th in week10.

Lab hours are held starting with the first week of intruction,
but not for finals week.
