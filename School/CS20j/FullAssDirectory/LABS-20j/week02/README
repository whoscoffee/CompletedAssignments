Hey, uhm this was the main program i was working on in week 2
its pretty much a revamped version of what i did in week one

So

	Classes:
	
		Designer.java //main class
		Group0.java  //this class is like xform.java from week 01, but more simple and made by me
		Rectangle  //im pretty sure this is just javafx.scene.shape.box copied and i was using it so i can understand how it works
		Textfeild0 // is a Textfield that only accepts numbers

		example   //example is my 2d line\art program i explain somewhere below.

		Maker     //this is a javafx 2d application that randomly generates a grid(further explaination below)




So in all i didnt do that much coding, but i was learning..

that being said, i was getting frustrated, so i moved to 2d

which is easier, so i made some line art with loops 


Then i wanted to make an ai like app, so my first attempt at that is maker

and what it does is makes grids 

it makes theses grid using Random,

a random number between 0 and Timz the variable (or in this class Timz = 10, so between 0 and 10)

this number is used to make the rows and colums

So if it randomly picks 5, then there should be 5 rows and 5 columns 

this grid is proportional to height and width variables

so it fills the scene with this grid


Theres also a button that goes through the 10 (or Timz) possible outcomes

without outputting the same outcome twice

this button clears the screen then replaces it with the next grid


so yea, my goal was to make something  using parameters

so that in turn ill be given optiions to look at.

i would like to explore this more, it seems fun.  





Note: ivent been able to get javafx to work on pengo

Jake
