Hey, uhm this was the main program i was working on in week 2
its pretty much a revamped version of what i did in week one

So

	Classes:
	
		Designer.java //main class
		Group0.java  //this class is like xform.java from week 01, but more simple and made by me
		Rectangle  //im pretty sure this is just javafx.scene.shape.box copied and i was using it so i can understand how it works
		Textfeild0 // is a Textfield that only accepts numbers

So in all i didnt do that much coding, but i was learning..

that being said, i was getting frustrated, so i moved to 2d

which is easier, so i made some line art with loops 





Note: ivent been able to get javafx to work on pengo


      

From,
Jake
