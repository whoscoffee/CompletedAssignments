Use these files to record your TBA hours for each week
replace the 0.0 default value with the actual value after 
that week is over.


The value is in hours.

See the course documents for the number of hours required
for each week

Example: 5 hours, 10 minutes completed this week 

5.17

During Spring semesters, you don't record hours for SPRING BREAK, and skip counting it.
None of the files I've given you represent Spring Break, so don't leave any of them blank.

So the weeks files are for the nth week of instruction, not the nth calendar week.
So use all week01 through week15 for both Spring and Fall semesters

For example in Spring 2012, Spring Break was Monday, April 9 through Saturday April 14th,
so you would have recorded your TBA hours of the week of Monday, April 2nd in week09
and your TBA hours of the week of Monday, April 16th in week10.

TBA Hours are recorded for the first week of intruction, but not for finals week.
